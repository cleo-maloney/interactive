      <div>How to Say Hello in Polish</div>
      <div>Have a Polish friend or know an exchange student from Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, or the Ukraine?</div>
      <div>Planning a trip to Eastern Europe? </div>
      <div>Though many Poles (especially younger ones) know enough English to understand “Hi” or “Hello,” greeting people you meet in their native language is a great way to start a conversation and make new friends. </div>
      <div>Just like in English, there are many different ways to greet people in Polish</div>
      <div>—knowing these different phrases (and the customs that Poles use to greet each other) can be a major asset if you anticipate meeting someone to use them with.</div>
      <div>To say "hello" in Polish, say "cześć." This very common, albeit somewhat informal greeting, is pronounced roughly like </div>
      <div>"cheh-</div>
      <div>sh-</div>
      <div>ch." </div>
      <div>Non-Poles may find it difficult to pronounce this word correctly. Following a "sh" sound with a "ch" sound is something that is almost never done in English.</div>
      <div>"Cześć" is a little informal to use in serious social situations. While it's fine for friends and family members, some etiquette-conscious Poles may be offended if you use it the very first time you meet them.</div>
      <div>"Cześć" may also be used to say "bye."</div>
      <div>Cześć</div>
  </div>
