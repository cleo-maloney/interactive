        <div>How to Be Interesting</div>
    <div>To be interesting, </div>
    <div>be interested. </div>
    <div>Pay attention to the world around you, and listen closely to the people you meet. Try new and different things: say yes to new experiences. </div>
    <div>Get educated about topics that appeal to you in order to broaden your conversational scope, and act social and friendly around new people, so </div>
    <div>they </div>
    <div>can see that you are an </div>
    <div>interesting person to know. </div>
    <div>Learn a new skill. </div>
    <div>Focus on a skill you have always wanted to try or been curious about, such as painting, drawing, crocheting, or dance. </div>
    <div>Then, teach yourself the skill or take a class on the skill. </div>
    <div>Having a new skill will help to broaden your experiences and give you </div>
    <div>something</div>
    <div>to talk about with others. </div>
    <div>For example, you may take a hip hop dance class if you’ve always been curious about the genre and want to learn something new. </div>
    <div>Or you may take a still life painting class to get better at painting figures. </div>
    <div>Taking up a new skill can also allow you to </div>
    <div>meet new people</div>
    <div>and expand your social network. </div>
    <div>This can help you learn more about different people and be more interesting. </div>
    <div>Develop expertise in topics that interest you. Think of a topic or subject that you have always been curious about and focus on learning more. Pick a new interest at random and learn all you can about it. Broaden your existing interests to include things you may know nothing about or have a burning desire to learn about. </div>
    <div>For example, if you are interested in music, you may get involved in online music forums and attend music shows to deepen your interest. </div>
    <div>Or if you are interested in painting, you may join a painting group to explore your interest in a deeper way. If you like to keep up with the news, you may go deeper by reading the texts behind different political theories, such as capitalism, socialism, and anarcha-feminism. </div>
    <div>Traveling is a great time to step outside of your comfort zone. </div>
    <div>You may encounter new and interesting experiences that you wouldn't have if you did what was familiar. </div>
    <div>Get out of your neighborhood and explore. If you can’t afford to travel too far, you may decide to explore a different neighborhood or space close to where you live. Perhaps you could take a day trip to a nearby historical site or to a community space. </div>
    <div>You can also do a short overnight trip to an outdoor area close by, like a mountain lodge or a cabin in the woods. Enlist some friends to go with you on a day adventure to see something new close to where you live. Try to make it a habit to try new things and explore new areas with friends or family. </div>
    <div>Once again, stepping outside of your comfort zone can give you unique experiences and stories to share!</div>
    <div>Donate your time once a week to a cause you care about. Volunteering is a great way to get involved in your community and meet new people. It can also expose you to different experiences and expand your worldview. </div>
    <div>For example, you may volunteer at a local arts center to get involved in the arts community and meet artists in your area. </div>
    <div>Or you may volunteer at a local soup kitchen to interact with people from different walks of life and give back to others. Go to cultural events where you live. Look up events in your local bookstore, community theater, or art gallery. Go to events so you stay up to date with what is currently going on in your area. Try to attend events that you may not usually go to or know much about so you can expose yourself to new things.</div>
    <div>For example, you may go to a community market to try new foods and look at interesting crafts.</div>
    <div>Or you may attend a local music festival so you can hear new music and meet new people. </div>
    <div>You can also look up online tutorials for things like how to curl your hair with braids or how to paint in oils. </div>
    <div>Read books about different subjects. Get books from the library or buy books from your local bookstore. Focus on a topic that you have a strong interest in and do a deep dive into books on the subject. Or pick a topic you know nothing about and read books about it to learn more.</div>
    <div>For example, if you have a strong interest in fiction books, you may try reading all the award winning novels that came out this year. </div>
    <div>Or if you have a curiosity about war history, you may look for books on different wars and conflicts at your local library or online. Join a discussion group on a topic you are curious about. Look for a discussion group at your local community center or online through forums and chat rooms. Start a discussion group with friends or family where you choose a topic and talk about it together. Find friends or acquaintances who you disagree with or share an opposing point of view and propose that you meet to discuss your ideas regularly. For example, you may start a discussion group on local politics with friends or family. Or you may find a discussion group that focuses on sports. </div>
    <div>Finding others who have differing opinions or ideas than you can help you to broaden your experience. </div>
    <div>Discussing your thoughts with them, and listening to what they have to say, can make you a more well-rounded person. Watch films and listen to podcasts about different topics. </div>
    <div>Expose yourself</div>
    <div>to media like film, television, radio, and podcasts so you can find out what people are talking and discussing. </div>
    <div>Try watching and listening to media that focuses on things you know about as well as topics that are new to you. </div>
    <div>For example, you may watch documentaries on topics that you do not know much about, such as transgender rights or globalization. </div>
    <div>Or you can listen to podcasts on topics you are familiar with, such as comedy or true crime. Tell good stories about your experiences. </div>
    <div>Be interesting by relaying stories in an entertaining way when you talk to people in your friend circle or at parties. </div>
    <div>Choose a memorable experience from a recent trip or discuss a </div>
    <div>funny experience</div>
    <div>at the grocery store.</div>
    <div>Use a personal story to connect with others and be social. </div>
    <div>Include only the important parts of the story, or the highlights, so your listeners are entertained.</div>
    <div>Use your body and your voice when telling the story so it is engaging. </div>
    <div>Talk with your hands, maintain eye contact, </div>
    <div>and create a character with your voice. </div>
    <div>Show pictures of your unique experiences too! Keep these on your phone for easy access when you need them. </div>
    <div>Be a good listener. </div>
    <div>Being an interesting person does not mean you always need to be the one talking in a conversation. </div>
    <div>Instead, you can show others that you are interested in them by being a good listener. </div>
    <div>Maintain eye contact and nod to show you are listening. Give the person your full attention and do not interrupt them when they are speaking. Try being a </div>
    <div>good listener</div>
    <div>to close friends and to people you just met at a party or gathering. </div>
    <div>You can often learn new things and become a more interesting person by listening to others speak. Connect with others about common interests. When talking to others, try to find out what you have in common. Talking about shared interests will engage the other person and make them more interested in getting to know you. </div>
    <div>When meeting someone, ask questions like "what are your hobbies?" or "what do you enjoy doing?" </div>
    <div>Remember that the more you try new things and experiences, the easier it will be to find similar interests with other people. This will show others that you are paying attention to what they have to say and interested in the conversation. </div>
    <div>For example, you may ask questions like, “What was it like working the night shift?” or “How did you adjust to moving to Canada at a young age?” </div>
    <div>Be open to exposing yourself to new people and interesting discussions so you can be well-rounded and in touch with what is going on. </div>
