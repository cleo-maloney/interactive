          </div>
    <br>
      <div class="font1">Maybe she’s dating your best friend. Maybe you’ve already dated, broken up with her, but still have feelings. Whatever your reasons, there are times you might want to hide your romantic feelings from the girl you’re attracted to. </div>

      <div>Taking care to conceal your feelings both in and out of her presence will help keep a lid on the truth.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font9 center header">Lie if necessary. </div>
      <br>
      <div>If the girl you like confronts you directly, hiding your feelings from her can seem impossible. Stay cool and react in a realistic way. Acting startled or surprised might give away the fact that you’re hiding something. </div>

      <div class="font2">Do not reply in a nervous manner.</div>
      <br>
      <div>There are many forms direct questions can take, but if she asks </div>
      <br>
      <div class="font11 center">“Do you have a crush on me?” or “Do you have feelings for me?”</div>
      <div>you might respond, </div>
      <br>
      <div class="font9 center">“No, why do you ask?” or “Certainly not, whatever gave you that idea?”</div>

      <div class="font2">If you don’t feel comfortable lying, rely in an ambiguous way. For instance, using the above example, you might simply reply “What makes you think that?” or “Why do you ask?” without including the explicit denial.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font4 center header">Lying might not be the best option. </div>
      <br>
      <div class="font11">She might be asking you about your feelings because she has feelings for you too.</div>

      <div class="font3">Stay aware of your own unconscious invitations for affection. There are certain unconscious cues indicating attraction conveyed by body language. </div>

      <div>For example, frequent, seemingly unnecessary grooming (touching your hair or smoothing your clothes), facing your body towards her, and thrusting your chest out and your shoulders back, all provide indications that you’re attracted to someone in your presence </div><div class="font12">and yearning for them to notice and touch you. </div>

      <div>Most of these can be stopped once you are aware of and looking for them in your own behavior.</div>

      <div>Keep in mind that these cues are effectively invisible unless someone is consciously looking for them. You have no need to worry that you're sending out "messages" of attraction.</div>

      <div>Show affection to another girl. If the girl you like believes you have a girlfriend already, or are interested in someone else, she’ll be unaware that you have feelings for her. By showing or expressing affection for another girl, you’ll effectively hide your feelings for her. Mention to a friend in an offhand way that you think another girl is cute when you’re within earshot of the girl you have feelings for. This will lead her into thinking you’re not interested in her.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font1 center header">Do not date another person just to mislead the girl you like. </div>

      <div class="font9 center">This third party could have their feelings hurt.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Watch what you say. Stay quiet around the girl you have a crush on. If you do talk, make sure your words are thoughtful and carefully considered. Talking too much, or too nervously, will tip her off that something in your attitude is amiss.</div>

      <div>If the conversation veers toward romantic topics, or topics which might induce awkward feelings for you, try to steer it back toward subjects which aren’t so close to home.</div>

      <div class="font4 header">Always speak in a steady, normal way. </div>


      <div class="font11 header">Don’t stutter or mumble when you’re speaking to her. </div>

      <div class="font5">Communicate as you always do with friends and acquaintances.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Utilize distractions to keep her attention from you. </div>
      <div class="font2">Distractions can be either a solitary activity </div>

      <div class="font12">(like a TV show) </div>

      <div class="font11">or a shared activity </div>

      <div class="font5">(for instance, a puzzle you work on together). </div>


      <div class="font9">In either case, your distraction should be something which doesn’t necessitate conversation. </div>
      <br>

      <div class="header">If you’re forced to talk to each other, you might find yourself in a situation where it’s hard to hide your feelings.</div>

      <div>Distract yourself if you’re unable to distract her. When she’s around, busy yourself with a videogame, a book, or your phone/tablet. Find an activity you can do alone, even if she is nearby. Whatever you do, ensure it precludes the possibility that you will express your feelings to/about her.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="center">Limit the time spent with her. </div>
      <div>When you’re with her, it is more difficult to avoid situations in which you feel the emotional pressure to confess how you feel about her. </div>


      <div class="font3">If you must spend time with her, do it in a big group or at a party. In group situations, you can easily avoid her and spend time talking to someone else, or wander off so that you’re not near her.</div>

      <div>Act disinterested. When the girl you’re interested in is around, maintain a pleasant but detached disposition. </div>
      <div class="center header font5">Be casual. </div>
      <div>Don’t ignore her or pretend you’re too busy to be bothered with her; that will upset her and hurt her feelings. </div>
      <br>

      <div>Rather, show mild interest in what she has to say, but no more than you would with any other friend or acquaintance. Do not become withdrawn or uncharacteristically quiet when you’re around the girl you like. Such behavior is a telltale sign that something in your emotions is amiss.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font6 header">Avoid gazing at her. </div>
      <br>
      <div class="font9 center header">She is, in your eyes, the purest beauty the world has ever seen.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font12 center header">You only have eyes for her. </div>
      <br>
      <div class="font9 header">But leaning forward in your seat, palms on your chin, is a sure giveaway that you have feelings for her. </div>

      <div class="font2"><div class="center header">Wear sunglasses (weather permitting)</div>if she’s around, and look away at the ground or at a fixed point in the opposite direction from where she is located in order to best hide the way you feel.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font11">Don’t talk to anyone about your feelings. </div>

      <div class="font1 center header">If your friends know that you have feelings for a certain girl, it's possible that they will tell their friends, then their friends will tell their friends and so on. </div>

      <div>At some point, this knowledge will reach the very ears it was never meant to—</div>


      <div class="center header">(those of the girl you like.)</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font11">Keep a diary. Write down all the thoughts and ideas you have about the girl you like in the diary. Write down the things you’d like to say to her but aren’t ready to yet.</div>
      <br>
      <div class="font9 center header">Do not express your feelings on social media like Twitter or Facebook. </div>
